## Setup

To use the Person Counter App, you need to download the `index.html`, `index.css`, and `index.js` files and save them in a folder on your local machine. The app can be run by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

The app's user interface consists of a header that displays the app's name, a div element that contains the people count, a Save button, and an Increment button. The people count is displayed using an h2 tag with an id of `count-el`. The count is initially set to zero, and the increment button updates the count each time it is clicked.

The Save button records the current count in a separate div element with an id of `save-el`. The save button appends the current count to the "Previous Entries" text each time it is clicked. The count is reset to zero after each save operation.
